Working features :\
  -Symmetry algorithm to force symmetry on given planes in the domain.\
  -Automatic naming of the output images\
  -Optimization of a bridge, a box and a wheel with symmetry\

Currently developping :\
  -A 3D interleaved planes extension in view to reproduce the results of [1] and try to apply symmetry to it\
  -(A more radial implementation of the symmetry to create wheels with odd symmetry (e.g. pentaradial wheel))\
